abstract = {When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

@inproceedings{Razmi2008,
abstract = {Previous studies report unusually high failure in ERP projects. Thus, it is necessary to perform an assessment at the initial stage of an ERP implementation program to identify weaknesses which may lead to project failure. In this paper, a new look at the determinants of organizational readiness to implement an ERP project is presented and using fuzzy analytic network process a practical framework is developed. The firm's current state of readiness regarding ERP project can be determined and necessary changes prior to implementation of ERP system can be specified. The assessment factors are identified after comprehensive study of critical success factors on ERP implementation. The proposed framework is applied to a real case and the advantages are illustrated.},

@inproceedings{Maroukian2021,
abstract = {The first decade of DevOps-orientation in software-intensive organizational environments is often characterized with an emerging set of skills that support DevOps practice adoption, targeting a cross-functional collaborative culture; with an aim of achieving a shift in mindset, skillset, and toolset. We investigate DevOps adoption constructs to facilitate development of a formative measurement model to support leadership throughout the DevOps transitional journey. The model and its constructs are designed and validated with a multi-method approach. Initially an exploratory study of a survey is conducted with 250 respondents 76{\%} of whom possess leadership roles, 93{\%} work in Europe and Middle East, and two-thirds are practicing as DevOps practitioners. Pertinent model indicators are produced and grouped under constructs based on survey results and validated using PLS-SEM. The formative structural model is presented and validated in three separate focus group sessions, comprising of respectively seven (7), five (5), and seven (7) participants all of whom had held leadership positions; from countries including USA, UK, The Netherlands, UAE, Greece, Georgia, Switzerland. Seventeen (17) focus group participants provided additional responses through a focus group in-session survey, which allowed feedback on specific model constructs. Results indicate that a set of practices, a set of skills, a set of metrics, DevOps adoption planning and the existence of the DevOps adoption leader roles, should be part of organizational aspirations in the definition of leadership in a DevOps transition path.},
