abstract = {When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

@inproceedings{Razmi2008,
abstract = {Previous studies report unusually high failure in ERP projects. Thus, it is necessary to perform an assessment at the initial stage of an ERP implementation program to identify weaknesses which may lead to project failure. In this paper, a new look at the determinants of organizational readiness to implement an ERP project is presented and using fuzzy analytic network process a practical framework is developed. The firm's current state of readiness regarding ERP project can be determined and necessary changes prior to implementation of ERP system can be specified. The assessment factors are identified after comprehensive study of critical success factors on ERP implementation. The proposed framework is applied to a real case and the advantages are illustrated.},
